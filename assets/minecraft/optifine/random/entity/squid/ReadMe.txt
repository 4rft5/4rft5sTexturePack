!!!!!!!! 4rft5 note

Credit goes to Thorolhugil, however for 1.20 I had to edit this pack directory otherwise the textures wouldn't work.
So the squids in the optifine folder are also hers, except the black and white ones which I made myself in Photoshop.
Sorry! I think that's against the guidelines, however I couldn't have a non-working pack in my pack.

THOROLHUGIL'S CUTE SQUIDS
----------------------------------------

This pack was crafted by reddit user Thorolhugil, known elsewhere as Olessan, after the reddit post about these squids (https://redd.it/b289zq) took off beyond expectations.

The original download is located here:
https://commiss.io/listings/m1zx

There are a few guidelines to using this pack:

--------------------------
TERMS OF USE

1)
DO NOT REMOVE CREDITS OR THIS .TXT FROM THE PACK.
These things mark packs as the work of their creators, and they are very important. They not only give credit to the creator, but also help you find it again, or find more of their work. Also, removing the credits makes you look immature and petty.

2)
DO NOT REMOVE THE MODELS TO INTEGRATE INTO OTHER PACKS, WITHOUT CREDIT.
You may integrate the model and texture into other packs, but only if the crediting remains on the files and credit is given in a text document.
If you are sharing the pack you have included the squids into publicly, you must note credit/link to original somewhere on your download page.

3)
DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE
You may redistribute (give the pack to others, like your friends) this pack. You may NOT redistribute the pack with credits removed, or for profit. That includes ad-enabled links like Adfly.

4)
DO NOT ALTER
You may alter this pack for your own usage, but you may NOT redistribute these altered assets as your own, unless they are unrecognizable (e.g. you turned the squid into some weird sort of fish). If still recognizable, the credit on the files must remain.


5)
ALL ATTRIBUTION MUST REMAIN.
Regardless of how you use the pack, and this is part of rules #1 and #2, make sure the credit remains alongside the model and textures.


----
A positive experience with the distribution of this pack may encourage me to release my other models eventually, so:
Please keep these in mind and follow them, and thank you for doing so.
Enjoy your cute squids! :)
