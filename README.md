# 4rft5sTexturePack
Repo for my Minecraft Texture Pack.

Downloadable from https://4rft5.com/minecraft.

Install the way you'd normally install your texture packs. I'll try and make branches for iterations of the pack based on Minecraft versions from here on out.

Original Read Me:
```
Hi! 4rft5 here. Thanks for downloading my pack.

All Textures/Sounds/Edits were done by me unless otherwise specified.

If you want to take something for your personal use, that's fine.
If you want to take something to reuse, please just give me some credit somewhere.

This works best with Fabric mods, which can be found online. Please don't get a virus downloading it.

That's about it, enjoy!

The squid model and two of its textures are by Thorolhugil, however I made two of the texture variants.
The Spawn Eggs came from @supermj767 on YT.

Disclaimer:

I don't know where the connected glass and font textures came from. If you come across this and know, please let me know so I can remove/give credit.
